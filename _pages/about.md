Hi, my name is Junheng, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southern California. I work with Professor [Quan Nguyen](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nguyen/Quan) at the [Dynamic Robotics and Control Laboratory](https://sites.usc.edu/quann/). My research focuses on dynamic control of humanoid robots in locomotion and manipulation (loco-manipulation) through model-based control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), Whole-body Control (WBC), and Trajectory Optimization (TO). I have served as the lead on [HECTOR project](https://github.com/DRCL-USC/Hector_Simulation).
